# House-Price-Prediction-
This project analyzes the Ames Housing Dataset to explore key factors affecting house prices. Using data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations, we identify strong predictors. A Linear Regression model is built and evaluated, providing a foundation for accurate price prediction and further modeling.




# 🏠 House Price EDA - Ames Housing Dataset

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project conducted on the **Ames Housing Dataset**. The goal is to explore and understand the key factors influencing house sale prices and prepare the data for machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📊 In-depth data exploration
- 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing
- 🔍 Missing value and outlier handling
- 📈 Univariate and bivariate feature analysis
- 🔗 Correlation heatmap & feature relationships
- 🧠 Foundational step for predictive modeling

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)

## 📂 File Structure
- `EDA_PROJECT.ipynb` - Main notebook with full EDA workflow


## 📈 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of over 1,400 observations of house sales in Ames, Iowa. Each entry includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes.

**Target Variable:** `SalePrice` (House Selling Price)
